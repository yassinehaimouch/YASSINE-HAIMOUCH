                <p>
                    Hey there! I’m Yassine, a self-taught developer fascinated by the prospect of using technology to aid in creating a fairer, more inclusive world.<br><br/>
            
                    I like to spend my time designing and building solutions, engaging with the community, as well as pushing myself to learn more through pair programming and group projects.<br><br/>
            
                    I have been studying physics and mathematics which also helps me improve my problem-solving skills. I studied front end from online courses from coursera in a 6 month after that I worked in many projects as freelancer which helped me gain the experience.
                </p>
                <h2 class="title">What I’ve been up to</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been recently focused on building websites, diving deeper into MERN STACK and tools surrounding it. I've also been learning lots too-like how to test my code effectively, optimizing performance and I've also started recently learning deeply advanced algorithms<br><br/>
        
                    I love to learn and build in public, you can find me on instagram @gitcoder I'm hoping to take this further by creating more content such as tutorials and posts.<br><br/>
                </p>
                <h2 class="title">Interests</h2>
                <p class="last-p">
                    I’m currently interested in building and supporting the community around web development, whether that be through my participation on instagram or events.<br><br/>
        
                    I’m also really into Design Systems and Component Driven User Interfaces and I love to explore the tools and techniques that help to create more scalable and maintainable UI’s.<br><br/>
        
                    When I'm not coding (or writing or reading about it) you'll typically find me engaging with another creative or engaging activity such as cardistry, chess, magic tricks, or occasionally getting lost in a favorite YouTube channels!<br><br/>
        
                    Although I love to keep myself busy with activities, I also make sure to set aside time to spend with family, going for walks and runs, as well as taking some time out for self-reflection when I can.

            <p>One of my favourite things since I starting to learn to code has discovering all of the amazing tools and abstractions developers have created to make theirs and other developers' lives easier. Here are some of the tools I use most frequently.</p>
